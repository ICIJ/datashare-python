# Deploy using Docker

## Running locally with Docker Compose

To run your worker together with Datashare, you can use the [`datashare-python`](https://github.com/ICIJ/datashare-python/blob/main/datashare-python) `docker compose` CLI wrapper:
<!-- termynal -->
```console
$ ./datashare-python up
```

## Deploying to a server

To deploy on a server, just use the image we've [previously published](build.md#publish-to-docker-hub) to Docker Hub.
