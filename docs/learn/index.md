This section is a tutorial and will guide you through the basic steps of building your own tasks for Datashare **from scratch**.

Rest assured, **in practice, you won't have to start anything from scratch**. The [get started](../get-started/index.md) section will show you how to create Datashare tasks by cloning the [datashare-python](https://github.com/ICIJ/datashare-python) template repo.

However, this section will teach you the basic steps it took to build this template.
