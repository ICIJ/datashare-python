# Datashare app



Before implementing Datashare tasks, let's learn how to transform any Python function into an task which can be run asynchronously by a worker using [icij-worker](https://github.com/ICIJ/icij-python/tree/main/icij-worker).

The `icij-worker` lib lets you turn simple Python functions into asynchronous task: 

```python
```

## Build an entire app

## Run your worker
